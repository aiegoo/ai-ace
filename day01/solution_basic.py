📚 LEARNING NOTES:

1. PRINT STATEMENTS:
   - print("text") displays text on screen
   - print() with no arguments creates a blank line
   - You can print special characters like emojis 🐔

2. STRINGS:
   - Text goes inside quotes: "hello" or 'hello'
   - Use backslash to escape special characters: \\

3. FUNCTIONS:
   - def function_name(): starts a function
   - Functions help organize your code
   - Call functions by typing their name with ()

4. COMMENTS:
   - Lines starting with # are comments
   - Comments help explain your code
   - \"\"\"Triple quotes\"\"\" for longer explanations

5. ASCII ART TIPS:
   - Start simple - even basic shapes work!
   - Use characters that create clear outlines
   - Don't worry about making it perfect
   - Have fun and be creative!

💭 REFLECTION QUESTIONS:
- Which chicken design do you like best?
- What characters create the best chicken features?
- How would you make your chicken look different?
- What other animals could you draw with ASCII?

🚀 NEXT STEPS:
- Try changing the characters in each chicken
- Add more details like wings or tail feathers
- Create your own unique chicken design
- Experiment with different layouts
